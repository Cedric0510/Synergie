SCARD DESIGN NOTES (summary)

Scope
- Game: adult couple card game POC. Manual now, plan for later automation.
- Focus: redesign core flow and effects based on beta feedback.

Beta feedback (main issues)
- Cards often unplayable.
- PI (life points) do not drop fast enough.
- Negotiation cards not shown on opponent screen.
- Negotiation validation handled by wrong player.
- Card launch costs unclear / forgotten / too complex.

Key decisions / direction
- Merge cards by theme: each card has 4 tiers (white/blue/yellow/red).
- Player can choose any tier up to their current color (ex: yellow can play white/blue/yellow, never red).
- Negotiation cards cannot counter red effects.
- PI are life points (not a spendable resource). PI loss is a penalty.
- Remove launch costs; keep one effect block per card.
  - If a condition is needed, include it inside the effect text.
  - Example: "If you are not nude, undress. Then opponent massages your back 30s."
- Manual phase now (physical card style), but plan for max automation later.

Automation goals (future)
- Define keywords that trigger game effects: draw, lose PI, disenchant, etc.
- Turn flow should be automated:
  - Phase 1 (start of turn): auto draw, show enchantments affecting player.
  - Phase 2 (main): if card effect is a keyword (ex: draw 2), apply automatically.
  - If opponent refuses an action: auto PI loss.

Design examples
- Theme "Kiss":
  - White: kiss on cheek
  - Blue: kiss on neck
  - Yellow: deep kiss
  - Red: deep kiss on intimate body part

Open items to define
- Keyword list and formal syntax for effects (for later parsing/automation).
- Refusal rule details (how many PI lost per tier, and when refusal cancels effects).
- UI rules for showing negotiation cards and who validates them.

Files / areas impacted later
- Game flow: game_screen + validation/response mixins
- Effects: card_effect_service + mechanic_service
- Cards data: assets/data/cards.json
